Module 3 - Python Challenge

This module contains two Python challenges. 

One called 'PyBank' that analyzes financial data over a period of years/months. The other challenge is called 'PyPoll' which analyzes voting records to determine the winner of a popular election.

PyBank reads in a CSV file to analyze the financial data and determines the total number of months for the financial period, the total profit/loss for the period, and the average change. It also calculates the greatest increase and decrease over the entire period compared between two months. The script prints all the data to the terminal as well as generating a text file located in the 'Analysis' folder (python-challenge\PyBank\Analysis).

PyPoll reads in a CSV file to analyze voting data from an unknown source. The script will tally the total number of votes, and the percentage and number of votes for each candidate. It also analyzes and compares the total votes for each candidate to inform the user who the winner is based on a popular election. The script will output the calculated results to the terminal, and finally print the same results to a text file in the 'Analysis' folder (python-challenge\PyPoll\Analysis).
